Hi, I'm Joe Kutner, a Software Architect at Salesforce.com, where I work on the [Heroku](http://heroku.com) platform and define engineering best practices for the organization. I'm a founding member of the [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io) project and sometimes I [write books](http://healthyprog.com/), too.
You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codefinger),
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joekutner/),
and [Github](https://github.com/jkutner).

I'm the author of [The Healthy Programmer](http://healthyprog.com/) and [Remote Pairing](https://pragprog.com/book/jkrp/remote-pairing).

The Healthy Programmer is available as an [audio book](https://pragprog.com/audio_books/jkthp/the-healthy-programmer-audio-book)
and it's on [Audible.com](http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/The-Healthy-Programmer-Audiobook/B00OMEE02E).
