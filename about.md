Hi, I'm Joe Kutner. I [write books](http://healthyprog.com/)
and curate the JVM at [Heroku](http://heroku.com).
You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codefinger)
and on [Github](https://github.com/jkutner).

I've written [Deploying with JRuby](http://amzn.com/1934356972),
[The Healthy Programmer](http://healthyprog.com/), and
[Remote Pairing](https://pragprog.com/book/jkrp/remote-pairing).

The Healthy Programmer is available as an [audio book](https://pragprog.com/audio_books/jkthp/the-healthy-programmer-audio-book)
and it's on [Audible.com](http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/The-Healthy-Programmer-Audiobook/B00OMEE02E).
